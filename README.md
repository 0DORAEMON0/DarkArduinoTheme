Dark Arduino Theme
================

Wasted much of a day building a dark theme/skin for the Arduino IDE.

####INSTALLATION
> preferences.txt
Replace your `preferences.txt` with mine - note the only main change is setting 'editor.antialias' to true, which makes your fonts look WAY better!

> theme folder with theme.txt and image files for buttons
Look in '~/Applications/Arduino.app/Contents/Resources/Java/lib' and replace the 'theme' folder inside (making a copy of the original in case you hate my changes!)
This folder contains a 'themes.txt' file with the bulk of the changes (mostly colors)
Buttons and tabs are stored as image files, which have been modified to fit the color scheme
